If the predicate is very complex or cumbersome to write, sometimes it’s easier to write the negation of that predicate for one of the branches, rather than the predicate itself. In binary search, you can see a lot of applications of this technique.\n",

    "- `while` loop is a type of **condition-controlled** loop and is often used when you don’t know in advance how many iterations you’ll need.\n",
    "- `for` loop is a type of **counting** loop and is often used when you know how many iterations are required, such as iterating over arrays, lists and strings of known length. In Python, a `for` loop inherently behaves like a \"for-each\" loop in other languages.\n",

    "You should also be familiar with the following loop control statements:\n",
    "- `break` immediately terminates the loop, and it's used for early exit when a desired condition is met.\n",
    "- `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next one.\n",
    "- `return` inside loop exits not just the loop but the entire function, which is common in search problems where a result can be returned immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic loop structure is the `while` loop structure, and all other loop mechanisms could be converted to a `while` loop. For example, `for` loop can be easily converted to `while` loop, but it's often easier to write and read than the `while` loop counterpart. In fact, in competitive programming, you’ll likely use `for` loops a lot (for counting or iterating collections) and `while` loops for more open-ended repetition."

When using `while` loops or `range`, such variables can still be useful.\n",

    "**Meaning and Role of Loop Variant**\n",
    "- The loop variant is a measure of how close the loop is to termination.\n",
    "    - In single-thread algorithmic programs, a loop is not supposed to run forever, and any loop should eventually terminate. \n",
    "    - For a loop destined to terminate in a deterministic way, it must have a finite number of iterations, and the loop variant acts like a counter of the number of remaining iterations, going from a non-negative integer to 0.\n",
    "- Another way to describe loop variant: You can think of the loop variant as a countdown timer toward loop termination.\n",
    "    - Each iteration ticks the timer closer to zero or some termination boundary.\n",
    "    - When the variant reaches a termination point, the loop stops.\n",
    "    - It's also equivalent to define loop variant as some numeric measure that strictly increases toward a limit with each iteration.\n",
    "- To be more specific, we can put loop variant under the context of programming elements.\n",
    "    - An explanation is to treat the loop body as a function, all the variables accessed(read or write) in the loop body as parameters of that function, and the output value should decrease for every iteration. \n",
    "    - Indeed, the variables accessed in the loop body can be divided into several categories and we will discuss that later. The ones that are directly relevant to loop variant are called **loop control variables**.\n",
    "- Although we typically assume a loop should always terminate due to some loop condition, there are exceptions especially when we consider multi-threading and event loop programs. \n",
    "    - For example, in a producer-consumer pattern multi-threaded program, the consumer could be long-running until the system stops it. \n",
    "- If you take a look at the wikipedia page of loop variant, you will see some rather formal academic definitions, so here we try to somehow simplify it but still keep the essence.\n",
    "- Both loop variant and loop invariant are connected with meaning and definition of variables accessed in the loop. \n",
    "    - There are variables accessed in the loop that are not considered as loop control variables and thus have little to do with loop variant, so it's normal for you to feel confused. \n",

    "**Loop Control Variables**\n",
    "- Loop Control Variables are variables used in loop conditions. Their values could be modified inside the loop body, and they could take many forms. \n",
    "- For example, in the Python loop `for i in range(n):`, the variable `i` is a **loop index variable**, which is a common type of loop control variable. It changes automatically with each iteration, and its values determine how the loop progresses.\n",
    "- Loop control variables directly control whether the loop continues or terminates, and thus they collectively map to an abstract measure of how close the loop is to termination, which is exactly the loop variant.\n",
    "- **Loop (variable) range** is closely related to loop control variables, which means the valid range of values that loop control variables could take and are allowed to go into the loop body. Typically, when those variables go outside of their valid range, the continuation condition will evaluate to false and the loop terminates.\n",
    "- Loop control variables also typically appear in the loop invariants. Due to their duel roles in the loop code, the choice of their definitions can impact the complexity of reading and writing the loop.\n",
    "- We care about how loop control variables are initialized outside loop, how they are updated inside the loop body, and whether they can lead to successful termination. \n",
    "    - For example, if we use a loop index as the control variable, we must ensure that:\n",
    "        - The **start value** should be such that the resulting range is non-empty, so that the loop actually runs.\n",
    "        - The **update rule** (e.g., increment or decrement) pushes the variable toward the **termination boundary**.\n",
    "        - The loop makes **measurable progress** in each iteration — meaning the control variable must move toward the condition that will eventually become false.\n",
    "    - In Python, such reasoning is often implicit in how we use `range()`:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      # This loop starts at 0, increases by 1, and stops when i == n.\n",
    "      for i in range(0, n):\n",
    "          ...\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      Here, `i` is initialized to `0`, updated by `+1` on each iteration, and the loop stops when `i >= n`. It guarantees termination in `n` steps.\n",
    "    - In reverse:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      # This loop starts at a and decrements until i <= b.\n",
    "      for i in range(a, b, -1):\n",
    "          ...\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      This behavior prevents accidental infinite loops in for-loops using range().\n",
    "    - However, when using a while loop with a manually updated control variable, it is your responsibility to ensure that the update rule moves the variable toward satisfying the termination condition. Otherwise, the loop may run infinitely.\n",

In Python, the loop `for i in range(n):` initializes `i` to `0` and increases it by `1` per iteration. The loop stops automatically when `i == n`, ensuring that the values of `i` cover the range `[0, n - 1]` — exactly once for each element.\n",
    "- **Connection to Loop Variants**: the loop variant in this case is the number of unprocessed elements, which is the size of the sublist `nums[i:n]`. As i increases, the number of elements left to process shrinks. When `i == n`, the sublist is empty and the loop terminates.\n",

    "- **Oversimplification**: A common oversimplification is to say: “In each iteration, `i` points to an element that gets added to `total`.” While technically true, this misses the broader role of `i` — it not only selects elements, but also tracks progress and defines the loop’s structure. Understanding `i` in terms of loop control and invariants provides a more complete picture.\n",

Thus we should define the meaning of `total` with regard to the iterations of the loop, that is to contextualize its meaning per iteration, which often leads to an invariant.\n",

At the start of iteration `i`, `total` holds the total sum of the sublist `nums[0:i]` (i.e., elements before index `i`). This invariant captures how much progress has been made in the accumulation process, and it depends on both the state of `total` and the loop control variable `i`.\n",
    "- **Initialization, Maintenance, and Termination**: `total` is initialized to `0`, which correctly reflects the sum of an empty sublist `nums[0:0]`. In each iteration, the element `nums[i]` is added to `total`, thus preserving the invariant that `total == sum(nums[0:i+1])` at the end of iteration `i`. When the loop terminates (i.e., when `i == n`), all elements have been processed and `total` contains the total of all values in the list.\n",

Assuming it represents the total sum at any point inside the loop is incorrect. The proper way to understand `total` is to define it **in terms of the current iteration**, which naturally leads to the loop invariant. In practice, loop invariants often describe the evolving meaning of state-carrying variables like `total`, while loop control variables like `i` are used as parameters that define the current “position” or “progress” of the loop.\n",

    "        - It may not be obvious in this case, but in a lot of algorithms, it would make your code harder to read and write.\n",
    "        - Because it doesn't closely reflect the evolving **loop variant** or the work done in the loop body.\n",
    "- **Variant-Based Definition**:\n",
    "    - Take a look at the image and think: what is the loop variant?\n",
    "    - It's the size of the unsorted subarray, or equivalently the size of the sorted subarray, but since they complement each other, either would work. This prompts us to consider defining $i$ in terms of the loop variant, the property that changes each iteration.\n",
    "    - You could define $i$ to be the size of the unsorted subarray. \n",
    "        - Initially it's $n$, and after the loop terminates it's $0$. So the loop range could be from $n$ to $1$. \n",
    "        - But in fact as we have analyzed, in the last iteration we only need to handle an unsorted subarray of 2 elements, so we can also let $i$ go from $n$ to $2$.\n",
    "    - In this scheme, the loop control variable directly tracks the loop variant: they are identical. \n",
    "        - As you will see, in the inner loop, we need to examine all pairs of adjacent elements in the unsorted subarray, which is delimited by the start and end indices. Its end index is fixed as $n-1$, and what is the start index for a particular $i$? \n",
    "        - Defining $i$ strictly as the unsorted subarray size would require translating that into array indices. We need to use equation to determine the value of the start index. \n",
    "        - Suppose the start index is $s$, then $n-1-s+1$, which is the length/size of the unsorted subarray, should be equal to $i$, then we have $s=n-i$. So the start index is $n-i$. It’s doable but not as straightforward.\n",
    "    - Using this definition would work, but in hindsight we have a better choice. \n",
    "        - Because loop control variable is not only used in loop variant to determine the number of iterations, it's also used in the loop body to delimit the subarray range that we need to perform work on in the inner loop, so we should consider implementation convenience too. \n",
    "        - We need to strike a balance between these two different requirements. Notice that loop variant is more for correctness analysis, so we can put implementation convenience first when writing the code.\n",
    "- **Index-Based Definition**:\n",
    "    - A more intuitive choice is to let $i$ be the start index of the unsorted subarray in each iteration, which is my personal pick.\n",
    "    - In the visualization, this is the clearest thing changing each time: on each outer loop iteration, the unsorted section starts one position further to the right. Using the end index of the sorted section would be similar but off by one.\n",
    "    - This definition isn't identical to the loop variant but they are directly connected: as $i$ increases and moves toward the end of the array, the size of the unsorted subarray decreases correspondingly.\n",
    "    - It also simplifies the inner loop, because inside the outer loop, the unsorted subarray is fixed as $arr[i:n]$ (or simply $arr[i:]$), which is simple and clear. We can write the inner loop bounds clearly without needing to compute indices like $n-i$, which reduces the chance of off-by-one errors.\n",
    "    - Although using Counting-Based or Variant-Based definitions also works, as you can always set up equations to solve for the start index, they are not as straightforward as directly using the start index. \n",
    "    - It's going to take longer time for the reader to understand and be convinced, and you also need more documentation to explain the code. You may be worrying about questions like \"is it $n-i$ or $n-i-1$?\".\n",
    "- By now we've considered three definitions of  $i$:\n",
    "    - **Index-Based**: `i = start index of unsorted subarray`\n",
    "    - **Variant-Based**: `i = size of unsorted subarray`\n",
    "    - **Counting-Based**: `i = iteration count`\n",
    "- The choices of the loop control variables vary from algorithm to algorithm, and different algorithms may favor different choices. \n",
    "    - For example, in binary search, the number of iterations depends on the input array, which is unknown to the programmer when writing the code, so Counting-Based definition is not workable at all. \n",
    "- Index-Based definition is a subset of Range-Based definition, and in practice it's often the most intuitive and convenient choice when implementing a loop, though ultimately it can be a matter of personal preference."

    "- The above image is a graphical visualization of what the inner loop does: it compares adjacent elements and swaps them if needed.\n",
    "- The inner loop is relatively straightforward, because from the outer loop analysis, we already know the range of elements we need to examine($arr[i:n]$) and the operation we need to perform (adjacent swaps of out-of-order pairs).\n",
    "    - The loop goal of the inner loop is essentially a subset of the outer loop's iteration goal, without the context of the sorted subarray because the inner loop doesn't concern itself with elements before index $i$ and it only focuses on the unsorted subarray. \n",
    "    - No particular loop premise, because the subarray won't be empty according to the outer loop conditions.\n",
    "    - For the edge cases, the inner loop don't need to worry about empty subarray, but need to handle subarray of only one element.\n",
    "    - The start and end indices of the unsorted subarray is clear: $arr[i:n]$, so it's natural for us to use a `for` loop and choose a loop control variable, say $j$, to cover all possible adjacent pairs of elements and perform the swap/exchange if necessary. \n",
    "    - In addition, after the termination of the inner loop, $j$ is useless for the outer loop, because we won't use other exit conditions in the loop, so it would always end up as a fixed-value, which is another reason for us to use `for` loop and declare it in the `initialization` part of the header.\n",
    "    - The loop variant is obvious: the remaining number of pairs of adjacent elements in the unsorted subarray. As we move \n",
    "- **Iteration Direction**: \n",
    "    - In the inner loop implementation, the **iteration direction** is more important than the other elements and it determines what $j$ represents: from $i$ to $n-1$ or from $n-1$ to $i$.\n",
    "    - Since we can only exchange adjacent elements, iterating from the end of the subarray to its start (from $n-1$ to $i$) can work but not the opposite direction.\n",
    "    - This is because we need to move the minimum element in the subarray to the leftmost position, which could only be done if we iterate from right to left. \n",
    "    - This has to do with the loop invariant: if you iterate from left to right, at the `j`-th iteration, only $arr[j]$ could be exchanged, and all elements in $arr[i:j]$ won't be touched, so if $arr[i]$ is not already the minimum of $arr[i:n]$, which is totally possible, you can't achieve your loop goal after the loop terminates.\n",
    "    - *Note:* On the other hand, iterating from left to right moves the maximum element in the subarray to the rightmost position. So you are implementing the BubbleSort by selecting the maximum for each iteration, you need to use this direction.\n",
    "- **Definition and Range of $j$**:\n",
    "    - As for the meaning of $j$, we again have many choices.\n",
    "    - Using $j$ as the counter of iterations works. You can definitely count the number of iterations, then let $j$ represent the first iteration ($j = 0$), the second iteration ($j = 1$), and so on. You could also use the reverse order of counting, from $j = n - i - 1$ down to $1$.\n",
    "    - You could also directly use the loop variant. The number of elements in the subarray is $n-i$, so there are $n-i-1$ pairs in total.\n",
    "    - Similar to the outer loop analysis, *the indices of the pairs of elements to compare* is most obvious in the image. The two indices in a pairs makes not much difference, so we can choose $j$ as the index of the element with larger index.\n",

We already know in the outer loop there will be $n$ iteration, so let's make $i$ go from $0$ to $n-1$.\n",

As $i$ grows, the length of the unsorted subarray decreases, and their relation is $l=n-i$ (because the number of iterations is exactly have many elements in the unsorted subarray have been removed to the sorted subarray). Now suppose the end index of the unsorted subarray is $e$, we have $e-0+1=l=n-i$, then we have $e=n-i-1$.\n",

In our graphical example, the whole array is already sorted when $i=3$, but continued until until $i=5$.\n",

This implies that if the unsorted subarray is sorted, then the entire array is sorted, and we can safely terminate the algorithm without executing the rest of the loop, which will swap no elements in the unsorted subarray anymore.\n",
    "- So the key to optimization falls upon whether we can easily identify that the unsorted subarray is already sorted. If you take a look at the method `is_sorted()` in the Property-Based Testing section, you will likely notice it's strikingly similar to the inner loop of Bubble Sort: *it checks for any adjacent pair out of order. If none are found, the subarray is sorted*.\n",

    "- **Loop Goal**: sort $arr[0:n]$ in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "- **Loop Premise**: $arr$ is not `None`.\n",
    "- **Loop Initialization**: initialize $i$ to $1$ in the `for` loop header.\n",
    "  - In fact both $0$ and $1$ work. We choose $1$ because a subarray of only one element is trivially sorted, so we don't have to insert into an empty sorted subarray. Thus the first element we need to insert is $arr[1]$.\n",
    "  - If you are uncertain about this, and you can just use either value temporarily here and come back to adjust it after you finish the inner loop.\n",
    "- **Loop Condition**: the loop continues as long as the unsorted subarray is not empty. \n",
    "  - Combined with loop termination and edge case analysis, we can use $i<n$ as loop condition.\n",
    "- **Loop Termination**: the loop terminates when unsorted subarray is empty. \n",
    "  - So after the loop terminates, $i=n$, and the whole array is sorted.\n",
    "- **Iteration Goal**: insert $arr[i]$ into $arr[0:i]$, making $arr[0:i]$ sorted.\n",
    "- **Edge Cases**: $n=0$ or $n=1$\n",
    "  - Using the loop condition we picked and the initialization choice, no iteration is required and correctness is guaranteed. This also means we don't need additional code to specifically handle them.\n",
    "- **Loop Variant**: the size of the unsorted subarray, which is $n-i$. \n",
    "  - we decrease it by 1 for each iteration, and in Python the for loop automatically increments $i$.\n",
    "- **Loop Invariant**: at the start of the i-th iteration, $arr[:i]$ is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "  - Notice that unlike Bubble Sort, we have no information between the elements in the sorted subarray and the elements in the unsorted array.\n",
    "  - **Initialization**: the invariant is initially true for the first iteration: $arr[0:1]$ is trivially sorted.\n",
    "  - **Maintenance**: if the iteration goal is accomplished, the sorted order is maintained, while sorted subarray grows by 1, then we maintain the invariant.\n",
    "  - **Termination**: after the loop terminates, $i$ would be $n$, which means $arr[0:n]$, the whole array is sorted and the loop goal is achieved.\n",
    "- **Loop Control Variable**: $i$ is the loop control variable acting as the partition boundary.\n",
    "  - It points to the element we need to insert for the current iteration, and it's the start index of the unsorted subarray that we handle in i-th iteration, while the end index is always $n-1$.\n",
    "  - So at the star of an iteration, the sorted subarray is $arr[:i]$, while the unsorted subarray is $arr[i:n]$.\n",
    "  - Its initial value is 1, which corresponds to a sorted subarray of only $1$ element, and we increment it by $1$ for each iteration. \n",
    "  - The loop continues until $i$ reaches $n$, ensuring that the value of $i$ covers the range of from $1$ to $n-1$, both end inclusively, making sure each iteration we insert only one element from unsorted subarray to sorted subarray.\n",

    "    - But we need to access the value of $arr[i]$ during the loop for comparison. In addition, after the loop terminates, we need to insert it into the correct position, so we can't afford to lose the data store at $arr[i]$. \n",
    "    - The standard solution is to use a temporary variable, say $entry$ to store $arr[i]$ during the loop initialization. Then we use $entry$ for all comparisons, and when we find the insertion spot, we write $entry$ into that position.\n",

Although we don't necessarily need compare all $arr[0:i]$ with $entry$: as soon as we find an element no greater than $entry$ the loop could stop, which suggests another part of the loop condition besides checking the range of $j$.\n",
    "    - Let's take a look the above three cases:\n",
    "        - For the **Best Case**, $j$ will end as $i-1$, and the insert position is $i=j+1$, so the entry stays in place.\n",
    "        - For the **Worst Case**, since $arr[0]$ is the last element to be compared with $entry$, after that comparison $j$ will be $-1$. This is ok, because the insert position is $0$, which is also $0=j+1$.\n",
    "        - For the **Common Case**, $j$ will points to an element no greater than $entry$, and in this case, the loop should terminate, and $entry$ should be inserted at $j+1$.\n",
    "    - We can see in all three possible cases, after the loop terminates $j+1$ is the correct insert position. So using $j$ in this way is sound.\n",
    "- **Loop Structure Choice**: Do we use `for` loop or `while` loop? \n",
    "    - Since `for` loop and `while` loop could be converted to each other, the choice of the loop structure is not so important. \n",
    "    - What is important is to notice that, we need to access the value of $j$ to insert $entry$ after the loop terminates, which means in Python, we need $j$ to be accessible after the loop, so we shouldn't overwrite it inside a $for$ loop that hides its value, which makes $while$ loop a more suitable choice.\n",
    "    - In addition, we also need to initialize $entry$ outside of the loop and access it after the loop. These reasons suggests `while` loop will be more clear and easy to read."

    "- **Loop Premise**: the $arr[0:i]$ is sorted.\n",
    "    - This is guaranteed by the outer loop invariant. So we can use it as given knowledge throughout the analysis.\n",
    "- **Loop Initialization**: initialize $j$ as $i-1$ and $entry$ as $arr[i]$ before the main loop.\n",
    "- **Loop Condition**: the loop continues as long as there are more elements to compare, and we haven't found an element no greater than $entry$. \n",
    "    - Combined with loop termination and edge case analysis, we see that $j \\ge 0$ `and` $arr[j]>entry$ is a proper expression for loop condition.\n",
    "    - It checks two things: that we haven't run off the left end of the array ($j \\ge 0$ ensures we still have elements to check on the left side) and that the entry $arr[j]$ is greater than the key (meaning the key should be inserted to the left of $arr[j]$).\n",
    "    - As long as both conditions hold, the loop continues. This condition embodies the idea \"while we haven't reached the beginning and $arr[j]$ is still greater than $entry$, keep shifting.\" \n",
    "- **Loop Termination**: we terminate the loop when there are no more elements to compare or we find an element no greater than $entry$.\n",
    "    - For the first case, it is the worst case, and $j=-1$. $entry$ should be inserted right at $arr[0]$.\n",
    "    - For the second case, we know that $arr[j] \\le entry$. $entry$ should be inserted right at $arr[j+1]$.\n",
    "    - Either case, after the loop terminates, all elements originally in $arr[j+1:i]$ before the shifting are larger than $entry$, and they have been already shifted to the correct position, which occupies $arr[j+2:i]$. \n",
    "    - And according to the above analysis, $j+1$ is the correct insert position. Thus inserting $entry$ to $arr[j+1]$ will make $arr[0:i+1]$ sorted. The inner loop’s job is done, and control returns to the outer loop to process the next element.\n",
    "- **Iteration Goal**: shift $arr[j]$ one position to the right if it's greater than $entry$.\n",
    "    - Inside the loop body, we already know that $arr[j]>entry$. Then we know that $j+1$, the temporary gap, is not the insert position for $entry$. \n",

    "    - Since we are shifting the elements in the loop, we need to note that elements in $arr[j+2:i+1]$ during loop, are actually the elements originally in $arr[j+1:i]$ before the loop, but are shifted one position to the right.\n",
    "    - Another way to understand this invariant is that except for the yet-to-be-placed $entry$ and the one-position gap we create by shifting, the order of the other elements is still sorted, exactly as before the loop runs.\n",
    "    - **Initialization**: the invariant is initially true for the first iteration, which is when $j=i-1$ : $arr[j+2:i+1]$ is actually $arr[i+1:i+1]$, which is an empty subarray, and $arr[0:i]$ is sorted.\n",
    "    - **Maintenance**: during the loop execution, we know that $arr[j]>entry$ according to the loop condition. The loop body will shift $arr[j]$ one position to the right, which is $arr[j+1]$, making $arr[j+1:i+1]$ sorted, which are the original element of $arr[j:i]$ in the same order before the loop. This preserves the order property for indices beyond $j$ because the element that was at $arr[j]$ was greater than $entry$ and also greater than all elements to its left.

    "    - Its initial value is $i-1$, which corresponds to the element immediately to the left of $arr[i]$ in the sorted subarray.\n",
