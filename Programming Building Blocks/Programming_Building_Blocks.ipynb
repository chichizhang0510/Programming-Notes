    "This is particularly useful when we only have a pair of `if-else`, meaning we’re covering exactly two possibilities (a binary decision). That’s essentially a binary partition: **the predicate and its complement**. If the predicate is very complex or cumbersome to write, sometimes it’s easier to write the negation of that predicate for one of the branches, rather than the predicate itself. In binary search, you can see a lot of applications of this technique.\n",

    "- `break` immediately terminates the loop, and it's used for early exit when a desired condition is met.\n",
    "- `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration (in a `for` loop, it still executes the `update` part before the next condition check).\n",

For example, `for` loop can be easily converted to `while` loop, but it's often easier to write and read than the `while` loop counterpart. In fact, in competitive programming, you’ll likely use `for` loops a lot (for counting or iterating collections) and `while` loops for more open-ended repetition."

    "**Notes**:\n",
    "- In single-thread algorithmic programs, a loop is not supposed to run forever, and any loop should eventually terminate. The loop variant is such a measure of how close the loop is to termination. For a loop destined to terminate in a deterministic way, it must have a finite number of iterations, and the loop variant acts like a counter of the number of remaining iterations, going from a non-negative integer to 0.\n",
    "- Another way to describe loop variant: You can think of the loop variant as a \"countdown\" toward loop termination.\n",
    "    - Each iteration \"ticks\" the countdown closer to zero or some termination boundary.\n",
    "    - When the variant reaches a termination point, the loop stops.\n",
    "- To put loop variant under the context of programming elements, an explanation is to treat the loop body as a function, all the variables accessed(read or write) in the loop body as parameters of that function, and the output value should decrease for every iteration. \n",
    "    - Indeed, if we take a closer look at the variables accessed in the loop body, they can be divided into several categories and we will discuss that later. The ones that are directly relevant to loop variant are called loop control variables.\n",
    "    - It's also equivalent to define loop variant as some numeric measure that strictly increases toward a limit with each iteration.\n",
    "- **Loop Control Variables**: variables used in loop conditions(including exit conditions), whose values could be changed inside the loop body. They could have many forms. \n",
    "    - For example in `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)`, the integer $i$ is a loop index variable, which is a common form of loop control variables.\n",
    "    - Loop control variables directly control whether the loop continues or terminates, and thus they collectively map to an abstract measure of how close the loop is to termination, which is the loop variant.\n",
    "    - A concept that is closely related to loop control variables is **loop (variable) range**, that is the valid range of the variables that are allowed to go into the loop body. Typically, when the variables go outside of its valid range, the loop condition will evaluate to false and the loop terminates.\n",
    "    - As you will see, loop control variables also typically appear in the loop invariant. Due to their duel roles in the loop code, the choice of their definitions can impact the complexity of reading and writing the loop.\n",
    "- Loop variants are represented by loop control variables, but they are not identical. \n",
    "    - A loop variant is typically derived from loop control variables. It is an abstract, logical measure that maps clearly to the control variables.\n",
    "    - Loop control variables are concrete variables modified each iteration and appear directly in loop conditions.\n",
    "    - For example in binary search, we have the $left$ and $right$ pointers of an array, which are loop control variables. But the loop variant is the size of the subarray delimited by $[left...right]$. A correct implementation of a loop ensures that loop control variables are updated after each iteration, moving the loop toward termination. Here the size of the subarray $[left...right]$ must decrease for each iteration, and when it reaches 0, the loop terminates.\n",
    "- **Loop Update**: Concrete code that modifies loop control variables.\n",
    "    - Loop Update is a concrete progress mechanism that changes the loop control variables, while loop variant is an abstract measure of progress.\n",
    "    - For example `i++`, `left++`, `right--` are loop update (the actual code modifying loop variables); while the size of search space, number of unprocessed nodes, etc are loop variants.\n",
    "    - The correctness and successful termination of a loop depends on loop update. For each iteration, at least one of the loop control variables should be assigned a new value. Otherwise the loop will run indefinitely.\n",
    "- We care about how loop control variables are initialized outside loop, how they are updated inside the loop body, and whether they can lead to successful termination. \n",
    "    - For example, if we use a loop index variable as the loop control variable, we should pay attention to the index range: the start index, the end index and how the index is updated. \n",
    "    - The start and end of the loop index indicates the range of the array/list that the loop will examine. The reason why choosing a specific start and end index often have some mathematical meanings in the context, and it's a good practice to state that in comment, unless it's very obvious.\n",
    "    - `for (i = a; i < b; i++)` is equivalent to `for(i = a; i <= b - 1; i++)`, both iterate `b - a` times. The loop range is `[a...b-1]`.\n",
    "    - `for (i = a; i > b; i--)` is equivalent to `for(i = a; i >= b + 1; i--)`, both iterate `a - b` times. The loop range is `[b+1...a]`.\n",
    "- There is a lot to talk about how the loop control variables could be updated.\n",
    "    - **Order-sensitive Loops**: Some loops depend on iteration order (stateful accumulations), e.g., DP, prefix sums.\n",
    "    - **Order-agnostic Loops**: Some loops don’t depend on iteration order (map-reduce style parallel loops), e.g., summing independent values.\n",
    "    - **Iteration direction**: Typically when traversing a list/array, iterating from left to right and right to left are equivalent(may requires some conversion on how we initialize and update the loop control variables). Sometimes one direction would be easier than the other and for some algorithms only one of the directions work.\n",
    "- If you take a look at the wikipedia page of loop variant, you will see some some rather formal academic definitions, so here I tried to somehow simplify it but still keep the essence.\n",
    "- Although we typically assume a loop should always terminate due to some loop condition, there are exceptions especially when we consider multi-threading and event loop programs. For example, in a producer-consumer pattern multi-threaded program, the consumer could be long-running until the system stops it. \n",
    "- Each loop could have multiple loop variants and the net effect is to take the minimum of them. \n",
    "    - For this reason, loop variants are closely tied to the time complexity of the loop.\n",
    "    - For example, a loop could have loop variant 1, which makes the loop terminates in 20 iterations, but the loop could also have another loop variant 2, which makes the loop terminates in 10 iterations. The net effect of the two loop variants, by taking the minimum, is that the loop will terminate in 10 iterations.\n",
    "- The time complexity of running a loop is directly tied to loop variant: \n",
    "    - The loop variant's rate of change impacts time complexity: how the loop control variables are initialized, how they are updated and when the loop terminates. So loop variant helps analyze loop performance from design.\n",
    "    - Variant decreases by $1$ -> $O(n)$\n",
    "    - Variant halves each time -> $O(\\log(n))$\n",
    "- Both loop variant and loop invariant are connected with meaning and definition of variables accessed in the loop. There are variables accessed in the loop that are not considered as loop control variables and thus have little to do with loop variant, so it's normal for you to feel confused. We will discuss their distinction and more about loop variant, loop control variables in the section of loop invariant."

As for the end of an iteration, in `for` loops, we consider it the moment after the update part in loop header executes, in the above example it's `i++`; in `while` loops, we consider it the moment after the last statement inside the loop body.\n",

    "**Know the Variables**: A key idea that cannot be over-emphasized - you should always be clear about the meaning/definitions of the variables that you declare and use in the program, as each of them serves a purpose and could be subject to some constraints. A clear and accurate understanding of every variables used in the program is the premise of ensuring we perform correct read and write operations on them.\n",

    "    - They don't change their value in the loop, so they could be considered as constants, but still semantically essential.\n",
    "    - They define boundaries and contexts for iteration and they’re referenced constantly. For the loop, they often act as parameters or inputs.\n",
    "    - They may not participate in control flow progression, and even though they’re not \"control\" or \"state\" variables, they form the logical framework in which loop computation takes place.\n",
    "    - They may appear in the loop condition (e.g., $i < n$), but since they do not change over time, and thus do not drive the termination, while the actual progress is made by Loop Control Variables.\n",
    "    - They may appear in the loop invariants (e.g., $nums[]$), but they don't carry stateful information, but provides the context of State-Carrying Variables.\n",
    "2. **Stateful Variables**: Variables that may be modified during loop execution. They play different roles in the logic and semantics of the loop and can be classified into three distinct categories:\n",
    "    1. **Loop Control Variables**: stateful variables that are read in the loop conditions, including the exit conditions. \n",
    "        - They control whether the loop continues or terminates.\n",
    "        - They collectively map to an abstract measure of how close the loop is to termination, which is the loop variant.\n",
    "        - They must change for each iteration, meaning at least one of the loop control variables should be assigned a new value. Otherwise the loop will run indefinitely.\n",
    "        - They are typically also part of loop invariants and they help describe how much work has been done. In fact, you can hardly analyze or describe a loop without reference to the loop control variables.\n",
    "    2. **State-Carrying Variables**: stateful variables that accumulate or evolve state of the loop, and often embody intermediate product of the loop.\n",
    "        - They represent state being built, accumulated, or transformed across iterations.\n",
    "        - They are directly tied to loop invariants, which describe their meaning per iteration.\n",
    "        - They have values that hold semantic meaning tied to the loop’s purpose, even though they don’t necessarily affect loop flow.\n",
    "        - They may or may not appear in loop variants.\n",
    "    3. **Incidental Variables**: all other stateful variables. Although they also have many kinds, we don't divide them further.\n",
    "        - They are modified inside the loop but neither drive the loop's control logic nor carry meaningful loop invariants.\n",
    "        - They mainly support secondary purposes such as side effects or auxiliary operations that are unrelated to loop control or algorithmic correctness. \n",
    "        - They include any variables defined inside the loop, and these variables are short-lived and temporary as they don't carry information across iterations.\n",
    "        - They include any variables that serve external purposes, such as logging, I/O, metrics collection etc. They are part of the loop's side effects but not tied to its main purpose.\n",

    "- It's possible for an variable to be both Loop Control Variable and State-Carrying Variable, and this often means it's part of both the variants and invariants.\n",
    "- For Stateful Variables, we say a variable could be modified when there is at least one statement in the loop that modifies its value.

    "    - Initially its size is $n$, for each iteration it decrement by $1$, and eventually it's $0$, which is the case when the loop terminate, so the last valid value should be $1$. From $n$ to $1$, that is $n$ iterations, so $X=n$. But if you take a closer look, we don't have to find the minimum element or exchange any pair of elements when the sub-array has only 1 element, so it's ok to leave the last valid value to be $2$.\n",
    "    - It' totally normal that you modify your code, for example the `for` loop header, back and forth when writing the loop to change the initial value of the loop index $i$ or its final value. Because before you fully implement the loop body, you only have an abstract overview of what you algorithm does and how it does the job. After you finish it, you can use the techniques of loop analysis to see if there are mistakes and correct them accordingly. That being said, if you are uncertain about the loop range, like the start and end valid value for $i$, leave it there and go on to finish the loop body first and then come back to decide the proper values.\n",
    "    - However, most of the time, counting the number of iterations and use it as the loop range is not the best choice. It may not be obvious in this case, but in a lot of algorithms, it would make your code harder to write, mainly because it doesn't connect closely enough to the loop variant, what we need to do in the loop body and how the state of the loop evolves.\n",
    "- **Variant-Based Definition**:\n",
    "    - Before we go on, take a look at the image again and answer the question: what is the loop variant?\n",
    "    - It's the size of the unsorted subarray, or equivalently the size of the sorted subarray, but since they complement each other, either of them would work. And this prompts us to consider defining $i$ in terms of the loop variant.\n",
    "    - You could define $i$ to be the size of the unsorted subarray, so initially it's $n$, and in the end(after the loop terminates) it's $0$. So the loop range could be from $n$ to $1$. But in fact as we have analyzed, in the last iteration we only need to handle an unsorted subarray of 2 elements, so we can also let $i$ go from $n$ to $2$.\n",
    "    - In this way, the loop control variable is equal to the loop variant: they are identical. As you will see, in the inner loop, we need to examine all pairs of adjacent elements in the unsorted subarray, which is delimited by its start and end indices. Its end index is fixed as $n-1$, and what is the start index for a particular $i$? \n",
    "    - You need to use equation to determine the value of the start index. Suppose it's $s$, then $n-1-s+1$, which is the length/size of the unsorted subarray, should be equal to $i$, then we have $s=n-i$. So the start index is $n-i$, which is acceptable and not too complicated.\n",
    "    - Using this definition would work, but in hindsight we have a better choice. Because loop control variable is not only used in loop variant to determine the number of iterations, it's also used in the loop body to delimit the subarray range that we need to perform work on in the inner loop. We need to strike a balance between these two different requirements, and notice that loop variant is more for correctness analysis, so we can put implementation convenience first when actually writing the code.\n",
    "- **Index-Based Definition**:\n",
    "    - My personal pick is the start index of the unsorted subarray.\n",
    "    - If you take a look at the image, it's most obvious changing element across iteration. The end index of the sorted array is also ok, but there is an offset of 1.\n",
    "    - Although not being identical to the loop variant, they are directly connected: as $i$ moves toward the end of the array, the unsorted subarray shrinks and its size decreases.\n",
    "    - In addition, it makes the inner loop easier to write, because inside the outer loop, the range of the unsorted subarray is fixed as $a[i...n-1]$, which is simple and clear and no more composite expression like $n-i$ is required.\n",
    "    - Although using the number of iterations or the size of the unsorted subarray also works (you can always equations to solve for the start index), they are not as straightforward as directly using the start index. And not being straightforward means it's going to take longer time for the reader to understand and feel convinced, which also means more documentation to explain your code. You may worry about questions like \"is it $n-i$ or $n-i-1$?\".\n",
    "- By now we have seen three different definitions of $i$:\n",
    "    - **Index-Based**: `i = start index`\n",
    "    - **Variant-Based**: `i = size of unsorted`\n",
    "    - **Counting-Based**: `i = iteration count`\n",
    "- The choices of definitions of the loop control variables vary from algorithm to algorithm, and in other algorithms we may have a different set of choices. For example, in binary search, the number of iterations depends on the input array, which is unknown to the programmer when writing the code, so Counting-Based definition is not workable at all. \n",

The loop invariant of BubbleSort is not trivial, and you can pause and take some time to think about it. A hint is to take a look at the image.\n",

For each iteration, the sorted subarray grows by 1, but still stays sorted, which is a truth across all iterations and helpful in sorting the entire array, because eventually the sorted subarray covers the entire array.

    "- The above image is a graphical visualization of what the inner loop does. Exchange of adjacent elements are simple.\n",
    "- The inner loop is relatively straightforward, because from the analysis of the outer loop we already know the range of elements we need to examine and the operation we need to perform.\n",
    "    - The loop goal of the inner loop is a subset of the iteration goal of the outer loop, without the context of the sorted subarray because the inner loop only handles the unsorted subarray. No particular loop premise, because the subarray won't be empty.\n",
    "    - The start and end indices of the unsorted subarray is clear: $a[i...n-1]$, so it's natural for us to a `for` loop and choose a loop control variable, say $j$ to cover all possible pairs of elements and perform the swap/exchange if necessary.\n",
    "    - The loop variant is obvious: the remaining number of pairs of adjacent.\n",
    "- **Iteration Direction**: \n",
    "    - In this case, the **iteration direction** is more important than the other elements and it determines the choice of meaning of $j$. \n",
    "    - Since we can only exchange adjacent elements, iterating from the end of the subarray to its start can work but not the opposite direction. \n",
    "    - This is because we need to move the minimum element in the subarray to the leftmost position, which could only be done if we iterate from right to left. \n",
    "    - This has to do with the loop invariant: if you iterate from left to right, at the `#j` iteration, only $a[j]$ could be exchanged, and all elements in $a[i...j-1]$ won't be touched, so if $a[i]$ is not already the minimum of $a[i...n-1]$, which is totally possible, you can't achieve your loop goal after the loop terminates.\n",
    "    - On the other hand, iterating from left to right moves the maximum element in the subarray to the rightmost position. So you are implementing the BubbleSort by selecting the maximum for each iteration, you could use this direction.\n",
    "- **Definition and Range of $j$**:\n",
    "    - As for the meaning of $j$, we again have many choices.\n",
    "    - The number of iterations work. You can definitely count the number of iterations, then let $j$ represent the `#0` iteration, `#1` iteration and so on. You could also use the reverse order of counter, from $n-i$ to $1$.\n",
    "    - You could also directly use the loop variant. The number of elements in the subarray is $n-i$, so there are $n-i-1$ pairs in total.\n",
    "    - Like the analysis in the outer loop, I prefer what is most obvious in the image: the indices of the pairs of elements to inspect. The two indices in a pairs makes not much difference, but I prefer to choose $j$ as the index of the element with larger index.\n",
    "    - By doing so, for each iteration the pair we examine is $(a[j-1],a[j])$.\n",
    "- Once the iteration direction and the meaning of $j$ are settled, most of the other elements are also clear. For the edge cases, the inner loop don't need to worry about empty subarray, but need to handle subarray of only one element."

    "- Suppose we want to implement BubbleSort by exchanging and selecting the maximum instead of the minimum as we did, and we choose to use the number of iterations as the loop control variable $i$. We already know in the outer loop there will be $n-1$ iteration, so let's make $i$ go from $0$ to $n-1$.\n",
    "- So in this case, the relative position of the unsorted subarray and sorted subarray is reversed: the unsorted subarray is on the left and the sorted subarray on the right.\n",

    "- We have to setup equations to solve it. When $i=0$, the length of the unsorted subarray is $n$. As $i$ grows, the length of the unsorted subarray decreases, and their relation is $l=n-i$ (because the number of iterations is exactly have many elements in the unsorted subarray have been removed to the sorted subarray). Now suppose the end index of the unsorted subarray is $e$, we have $e-0+1=l=n-i$, then we have $e=n-i-1$.\n",

This implies that if the unsorted subarray is also sorted, then the entire array is sorted, and we can terminate the algorithm without executing the rest of the loop, which will swap no elements in the unsorted subarray anymore.\n",
    "- So the key of optimization falls upon whether we can easily identify that the unsorted subarray is already sorted. If you take a look at the method `isSorted()` in the Property-Based Testing section, you will likely notice that it's strikingly similar to the inner loop of Bubble Sort: if there are no pairs are in wrong order, then the entire subarray is sorted.\n",
    "- Based on the above observation, we can keep track of an additional boolean variable `swapped` which acts as a flag whether any swapping takes place in the inner loop, and if it's false after the inner loop terminates, according to our analysis, we can safely terminate the algorithm.\n",

    "    - For example, in the common case of the above image, if we scan from left to right, both $a[0]$ and $a[1]$ don't involve in shifting, so this kind of drifts from our choice of **Search while Shifting**. \n",
    "    - For **Search while Shifting**, we should scan from left to right, starting from the last element in the sorted subarray. In this case, every element that is larger than th new element will be compared and shifted.\n",
    "    - There is some uncertainties about the insert position for a particular new element, so we cannot say right-to-left is definitely better than left-to-right when we use **Search then Shifting**, at least in terms of the number of comparison.\n",
    "- **Definition and Range of $j$**: it's obvious that the good definition of $j$ is to the array index of elements to be compared.\n",
    "    - Like in Bubble Sort, there are other choices, but you should be able to see why use $j$ directly point to the elements to be compared with the new element is the go-to choice. \n",
    "    - In addition, doing so makes $j$ directly related to the insert position we want to locate.\n",
    "    - This means the range of $j$ is $[0...i-1]$, although we don't necessarily need compare all $a[0...i-1]$ with $entry$: as soon as we find an element no greater than $entry$ the loop could stop, which suggests another part of the loop condition besides checking the range of $j$.\n",
    "    - Let's take a look the above three cases:\n",
    "        - For the **Best Case**, $j$ will end as $i-1$, so the insert position is $j+1$.\n",
    "        - For the **Worst Case**, since $a[0]$ is the last element to be compared with $entry$, after that comparison $j$ will be $-1$. This is ok, because the insert position is $0$, which is also $j+1$.\n",
    "        - For the **Common Case**, $j$ will points to an element no greater than $entry$, and in this case, the loop should terminate, and $entry$ should be inserted at $j+1$.\n",
    "    - We can see in all three possible cases, after the loop terminates $j+1$ is the correct insert position. So using $j$ in this way is sound.\n",
    "- **Loop Structure Choice**: Do we use `for` loop or `while` loop? \n",
    "    - Since `for` loop and `while` loop could be converted to each other, the choice of the loop structure is not so important. \n",
    "    - What is important is to notice that, we need to access the value of $j$ to insert $entry$ after the loop terminates, which means if we use `for` loop, we cannot declare $j$ inside the `for` loop header.\n",
    "    - In addition, we also need to initialize $entry$ outside of the loop and access it after the loop. These reasons suggests using `while` loop will be more clear and easy to read."

    "After the above analysis, we have figured out the loop elements of the inner loop.\n",
    "- **Loop Goal**: insert the element $a[i]$ into the sorted subarray $a[0 .. i-1]$ so that after insertion, $a[0 .. i]$ is sorted.\n",
    "- **Loop Premise**: the $a[0 .. i-1]$ needs to be sorted.\n",
    "    - This is guaranteed by the outer loop invariant So we can use it as a prior knowledge throughout the analysis.\n",
    "- **Loop Initialization**: initialize $j$ as $i-1$ and $entry$ as $a[i]$ before the main loop.\n",
    "- **Loop Condition**: the loop continues as long as there are more elements to compare, and we haven't found an element no greater than $entry$. \n",
    "    - Combined with loop termination and edge case analysis, we see that $j \\ge 0$ `AND` $a[j]>entry$ is a proper expression for loop condition.\n",
    "    - It checks two things: that we haven’t run off the left end of the array ($j \\ge 0$ ensures we still have elements to check on the left side) and that the current element $a[j]$ is greater than the key (meaning the key should be inserted to the left of $a[j]$).\n",
    "    - As long as both conditions hold, the loop continues. This condition embodies the idea \"while we haven't reached the beginning and the key is still smaller than the element at $a[j]$, keep shifting.\" \n",
    "- **Loop Termination**: we terminate the loop when there are no more elements to compare or we find an element no greater than $entry$.\n",
    "    - For the first case, it is the worst case, and $j=-1$.\n",
    "    - For the second case, we know that $a[j] \\le entry$.\n",
    "    - Either case, after the loop terminates, all elements originally in $a[j+1...i-1]$ before the shifting are larger than $entry$, and they have been already shifted to the correct position. \n",
    "    - And according to the above analysis, $j+1$ is the correct insert position. Thus inserting $entry$ to $a[j+1]$ will make $a[0 .. i]$ is sorted. The inner loop’s job is done, and control returns to the outer loop to process the next element.\n",
    "- **Iteration Goal**: shift $a[j]$ one position to the right if it's greater than $entry$.\n",
    "    - Inside the loop body, we already know that $a[j]>entry$. Then we know that $j+1$, the temporary gap, is not the insert position for $entry$. \n",
    "    - So by moving a larger element out of the way to $a[j+1]$ and decrementing $j$, we continue to consider the next position as a potential candidate for insertion.\n",
    "- **Edge Cases**: both best case and worst case are edge cases, and we have analyzed them in the previous discussion.\n",
    "    - Even in edge cases, $j+1$ is still the correct insert position and all involved elements will be correctly shifted, so no additional code is required to handle edge cases specifically.\n",
    "- **Loop Variant**: the number of unexamined adjacent elements in the sorted subarray, which is $j+1$. \n",
    "    - We decrease it by 1 for each iteration, so `j--` is how we update the loop control variable and make sure the loop will terminate.\n",
    "    - With each iteration, j moves closer to the beginning of the array (toward -1), guaranteeing that the loop will eventually end. Even in the worst case, the loop finishes after $i$ comparisons/shifts.\n",
    "- **Loop Invariant**: at the start of the `#j` iteration, $entry$ < MIN($a[j+2...i]$); both $a[0...j]$ and $a[j+2...i]$ are sorted, and their concatenation is the original sorted subarray $a[0...i-1]$.\n",
    "    - Since we are shifting the elements in the loop, we need to note that elements in $a[j+2...i]$ during loop, are actually the elements originally in $a[j+1...i-1]$ before the loop, but are shifted one position to the right.\n",
    "    - Another way to understand this invariant is that except for the yet-to-be-placed $entry$ and the one-position gap we create by shifting, the order of the other elements is still sorted, exactly as before the loop runs.\n",
    "    - **Initialization**: the invariant is initially true for the first iteration, which is when $j=i-1$ : $a[j+2...i]$ is actually $a[i+1...i]$ is an empty subarray, and $a[0...i-1]$ is sorted.\n",
    "    - **Maintenance**: during the loop execution, we know that $a[j]>entry$ according to the loop condition. The loop body will shift $a[j]$ one position to the right, which is $a[j+1]$, making $a[j+1...i]$ sorted, which are the original element of $a[j...i-1]$ in the same order before the loop. This preserves the order property for indices beyond $j$ because the element that was at $a[j]$ was greater than $entry$ and also greater than all elements to its left. At the end of the iteration, $j--$ executes and we we maintain the invariant.\n",
    "    - **Termination**: After the loop terminates, $j$ could be $-1$ (in the worst case), or $i-1$ (in the best case), or between them. No matter which case, inserting $entry$ to $a[j+1]$ would make $a[0 .. i]$ sorted. \n",
    "- **Loop Control Variable**: $j$ is the loop control variable. \n",
    "    - We use it to scan elements in the sorted subarray from right to left, and for the `#j` iteration it points to the element $a[j]$. \n",
    "    - Its initial value is $i-1$, which corresponds to the element immediately to the left of $a[i]$ in the sorted subarray.\n",
    "    - The loop moves $j$ leftwards decrementing it by $1$ for each iteration, as long as the element at $a[j]$ is greater than $entry$.\n",
    "    - The loop continues until $j$ reaches $-1$ or exit when $a[j] \\le entry$. This ensures that the value of $j$ covers the range of $[0...i-1]$ if no such element is found, making sure we examine all elements and find the correct insert position."
